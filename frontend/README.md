Tara is thinking of implementing this in NextJS.

What does the frontend need to do?
1) Home Page
- Site description
- User registration or log in
2) Log in or Sign Up Page
- email field
- password field
- full name
3) User Dashboard
- Upload and Download pdfs in a sidebar
- Send queries
4) Project page
- Separate the user's work by topic
