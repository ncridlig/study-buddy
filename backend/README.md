This is the backend service for the study-buddy project, built with Django and Dockerized for easy deployment. It handles user authentication, topic and file management, and provides API documentation via Swagger.

## üöÄ Features

- üîê User authentication system
- üìÇ Topic and file management
- üìù API documentation with Swagger
- üê≥ Dockerized for easy deployment
- ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable environment settings

‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose installed

- `.env` file with correct environment variables (see below)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. üîê Create a `.env` file

Make a copy of `.env.production.example` and rename it as `.env`. Then edit `.env` file as follows:

- `SECRET_KEY`  
  Produce value for this field using [djecrety](https://djecrety.ir/). This is needed for running a Django application.

- `DEBUG`  
  Set this field to _True_ for activating debug mode and see output logs. Set it to _False_ for real world scenarios.

- **Database** configurations  
  `NAME=your_db_name`
  `USER=your_db_user`
  `PASSWORD=your_db_password`
  `HOST=your_db_host`
  `PORT=your_db_port`

- **Superuser** information  
  `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL=superuser_email`
  `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_FIRSTNAME=superuser_firstname`
  `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_LASTNAME=superuser_lastname`
  `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=superuser_password`

- **Settings** Module  
  Use `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = 'study.settings.developement'` if you intend to run the app locally. And use `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = 'study.settings.production'` if you intend to run it using containerizing applications such as Docker.

- **REDIS** configuration  
  Set `REDIS_HOST` to the name of redis container in docker-compose file, if you plan to use docker. Otherwise, in case you intend to run the app locally, no need to have this variable in your `.env` file.

- **ALLOWED** requests  
  The `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting defines which host/domain names are valid when making requests to this Django service. Django will reject any incoming request with a `Host` header that is **not** listed in `ALLOWED_HOSTS`. For example, `ALLOWED_HOSTS="web web:8000 localhost 127.0.0.1 [::1]"` allows requests with `Host` headers matching `web`, `web:8000`, `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `[::1]` (IPv6 loopback). This is particularly important when other services try to communicate with this backend.

- **CORS** Support  
  To allow external services (e.g., frontend), have access to this application, you need to put their corresponding origins in `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and separate them with a space. For instance, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000 http://127.0.0.1:3000"`, grants access to `http://localhost:3000` and `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

- `LLM_SERVICE_URL`  
  This variable defines the endpoint of the LLM microservice to which the backend sends Q&A generation requests.

## 2. üì¶ Create Docker volumes and network

you must create the external volumes and network used by docker-compose.yml:

```bash
docker volume create pgdata
docker volume create static_volume
docker volume create media_volume
docker volume create rd1-data
docker network create app-network
```

To establish the communication of backend and LLM-Service, you need to build the bridge between them as well:

```bash
docker network create shared-bridge
```

## 3. üöÄ Run the containers

Start the application stack (remember to change directory to where `docker-compose.yml` file exists):

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

You can check the state of containers:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

## üåê Accessing the Application

- Admin Panel: http://localhost/admin/
- Swagger API Docs: http://localhost/docs/

---

## üßπ Clean Up

To stop and remove all containers:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```
