This is the LLM-service for the study-buddy project.

**The rest of explanations for LLM part need to be added**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. üîê Create a `.env` file

Make a copy of `.env.production.example` and rename it as `.env`. Then edit `.env` file as follows:

- `REDIS_HOST`  
  Set a name for redis database of LLM-service. Keep this in mind that this must be different from the name used for redis database in backend `.env` file.

- `BACKEND_URL`  
  If you intend to use the current docker compose file, then set this variable to `http://web:8000/result/llm_callback/` or `http://web/result/llm_callback/`. In case you decided to modify backend service name, change these address accordingly.

- _Asynchronous Heavy LLM Jobs_ Configs  
  `ASYNC_JOB_MAX_RETRIES`=maximum number of times that LLM-Service retries to send the results to backend(in case backend was down for any reason)
  `ASYNC_JOB_RETRY_DELAY`=period to wait between each retry(in seconds)
  `ASYNC_JOB_TIMEOUT`=period to keep and not delete the results(in seconds)
  `MARK_LEFTOVER_RESULT_KEY`=the name of the key to add to the dictionary result of a task. It is used to mark the tasks whose results have been produced, but the transfer of results to backend have been unsuccessful.

## 2. üì¶ Create Docker volumes and network

you must create the external volumes and network used by docker-compose.yml:

```bash
docker volume create rd2-data
docker network create llm-app-network
```

## 3. üöÄ Run the containers

Start the application stack (remember to change directory to where `docker-compose.yml` file exists):

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

You can check the state of containers:

```bash
docker ps -a
```
